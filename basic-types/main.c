/* * 
    * Basic Types [Arithmetics]
    * (A) Integer:
        * char 1 Byte -128 to 127
            * unsigned char 1 Byte 0 to 255
            
        * int: It can be 2 or 4 bytes, it allows to have negative and positive numbers but no decimal values.
            * 2 Bytes -32,768 to 32,757
            * 4 bytes -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483
            * unsigned int: it can be 2 or 4 bytes, it doesn't allow negative data.
                * 2 Bytes 0 to 65.535
                * 4 bytes 0 to 4,294,967,295
                
        * short 2 bytes
            * 2 bytes -32,768 to 32,767
            * unsigned short 2 bytes 0 to 65,535

        * long 8 Bytes
            * long 8 bytes -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
            * unsigned long 8 bytes 0 to 18446744073709551615

    * (B) Floating point:
        * float 4 bytes 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+386 (6 decimal places)
        * double 8 bytes 2.3E-308 to1.7E+30815 (15 decimal places)
        * long double 10 bytes 3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+493219 (19 decimal places) 
        
    * (C) Void: The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations:
        * Function returns as void
        * Function arguments as void
        * Pointers to void
